            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN my former, I gave you an Account of the late King's coming before <hi>London Derry,</hi> and what afterwards happen'd, till the 23d. of <hi>April,</hi> when <hi>Kilmore</hi> was ſurrendred, at which time Colonel <hi>Lundce</hi> their then Governour, that very Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made his Eſcape. It now remains, that I give a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of what has fallen out ſince, and of the Condition of the Place.</p>
            <p>The Beſieged having rejected all Offers made them by the late King, and provok'd the Beſiegers in divers Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; as alſo being uncertain when Relief would arrive from <hi>England,</hi> reſolv'd to put themſelves into the beſt Poſture they could; and to that purpoſe unanimouſly declar'd their Reſolutions to Live and Die with their new Governour, Mr. <hi>George Walker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henry Baker,</hi> and to ſubmit with an entire Obedience to their Conduct and Commands for defence of the City.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place they examin'd the Publick Treaſury, where they expected to have found the Five hundred Pounds ſent them from <hi>London</hi> by Captain <hi>Beverly,</hi> in the firſt Ship that brought them Arms and Ammunition, and a far greater Sum, but the Birds were flown. Then they took a View of the Ammunition and Stores, and found near 500 Barrels of Powder untouch'd, Ball and March ſufficient, as alſo Bullets for their great Guns, of which they have 24 mounted upon the Baſtions of the Walls, upon the Tower of the Church two, and eight within the City; that is to ſay, one at each Gate, and one at each Corner of the Market-Houſe in the middle of the City, and fronting each Gate.</p>
            <p>In the third place, They made Inſpection into the Stores of Proviſions, and found a vaſt quantity of wheat, Meal, Oat-meal, Beef, Bacon, Salt, Salmon, and Butter, Cheeſe, Malt, Beer, Brandy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was all Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory'd, and put into publick Store-Houſes, with Guards ſet over them. Alſo all Merchants, and Tradeſmen, to prevent imbezling their Wares, and Merchandizes, took Inventories of their ſeveral Goods, and carry'd them into publick Store-Houſes, which are guarded day and night.</p>
            <p>Moreover, upon a Muſter of all that bore Arms, they were found to be about 12000, which are all form'd into Regiments and Companies, every Regiment under a Col. Lieutenant Col. Major, and Captain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> amounting to 17 in all. The Colonels are,

            <p>Eight more whoſe Names I do not at preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tho. Johnſon</hi> is alſo made Mayor of the Town.</p>
            <p>All the Women and Children that brought no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance along with them into the City, nor could give any account of themſelves; as alſo many that are unfit to bear Arms, were put our of the Town juſt before the Siege began, which was one reaſon that they have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny now in Arms, in regard that many who brought no Subſiſtance into the Town, rather than be turn'd out of the Gates, gladly took up Arms to earn their Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. But of two thouſand Horſe, which after the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants were broken at <hi>Clawde-Ford,</hi> march'd into <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Derry;</hi> there are not now a hundred left for want of <hi>Forrage,</hi> which conſtrain'd them to turn the Horſes out of the Gates, the greateſt part of which fell into the Enemies hands, only ſome few are ſtill left that graze under the protection of the City Canon, which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> however now and then pick up, as often as they dare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and for which as often they pay very dearly, being either ſhot dead, wounded, or taken Priſoners.</p>
            <p>The great Gates of the City are barricado'd within<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide with huge pieces of Timber; the Keys are kept at the Main-Guard, and eight Captains, two to a Gate are upon the Watch every Night. When there is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Keys are not to be deliver'd, as was uſual to a Serjeant, but into the hands of the Captains that guard the particular Poſt.</p>
            <p>Two Regiments are upon Duty every Night, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the leaſt Alarum they are all to repair to the Walls, without expecting any other Orders.</p>
            <p>There are in the Town five Miniſters who have the Commands of ſo many Companies, and have every one of them given ſignal Proofs of their Valour; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly one Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Jenney.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The private Souldiers are all in good Heart; the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to each Man for a Week, being a Salmon and a half, two pound of Beef, and four quarts of Oat-meal. Good ſtrong Beer is alſo order'd to be ſold at a Penny a Quart, though not to the Souldiers after Eight at night, to avoid Diſorders.</p>
            <p>Blinds are alſo ſet up by the Command of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to ſecure the Men upon the Walls from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Battery.</p>
            <p>There is in <hi>Derry</hi> one <hi>C. Darus</hi> of <hi>Plattin,</hi> in the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Meath,</hi> who is kept a Priſoner, as having been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at <hi>Chappel</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was one that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Recruits ſent by <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> to the late King into <hi>England.</hi> General <hi>Hamilton</hi> has wrote ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Letters to the Governours to have this Captain ſet at Liberty, but they do not think fit to part with him; nevertheleſs they uſe him civilly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> alſo very much lament the loſs of Major <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Nangle,</hi> (the Son of Tory <hi>Nangle,</hi> that was ſhot at <hi>Longford-Bridge</hi>) who together with two Troopers was drown'd, while they endeavour'd to get over the Paſs at <hi>Clawdeeford.</hi> 'Tis alſo believ'd that Col. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic Sheldon</hi> is dead of the Wounds he receiv'd in one of the Sallies made by the Beſieged, from the hands of one Mr. <hi>Arthur Ivory,</hi> a brisk young Gentleman, who fought the Colonel hand to hand, till at length two of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:34523:2"/>coming into the Colonel's Reſcue, ſhot the Gentleman, dead.</p>
            <p>The late King has made Col. <hi>Charles Moore</hi> Governour of <hi>Colraign,</hi> where he keepr with a Garriſon conſiſting of 1000 Men. The Marqueſs of <hi>Antrim</hi> is made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Charrick Fergus,</hi> which has the ſame number of Souldiers to defend it. And <hi>Gourdon Oncale</hi> is alſo made Governour of <hi>Charlemont,</hi> though not having with him above 200 Souldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cheſter,</hi> The laſt Week arrived here a Veſſel from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with Paſſengers, who credibly report, that the late King have received Advice from the Camp before <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that they were not a number ſtrong enough to ſtorm the City, nor to withſtand the Enemy, ſhould they have Succours from <hi>England:</hi> and beſides that they wanted Ammunition and great Guns, gave Orders for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Recruit to march Northward, but that when they came within two days March of <hi>Derry,</hi> the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Commanded by young Sir <hi>Maurice Austace</hi> in the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> and ſome other Regiments fell into a great Mutiny, ſwearing by their <hi>Shouls</hi> they would not go to the King's Slaughter-Houſe to be kill'd, as the <hi>French</hi> Generals, Sir <hi>Patrick Dowdel,</hi> Major <hi>Taaf,</hi> and the reſt had been, and that they wolud rather turn to the Proteſtants, and ſerve King <hi>William,</hi> than be Slaves to the <hi>French.</hi> Upon which hundreds of them ran away, and betook themſelves to the Bogs and Mountains.</p>
            <p>On Saturday <hi>May</hi> the 18th arriv'd from <hi>Dublin</hi> at <hi>Dawpool,</hi> betwixt <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Liverpool,</hi> one <hi>Can,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of a Veſſel belonging to thoſe parts, on Board of whom were wany Paſſengers, who had all of them Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for which they paid at the Secretaries Office in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> 3 <abbr>

They alſo ſay further, That the Duke of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> was at <hi>Chappel I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,</hi> but dangerouſly ill of the black Jaundies, and of a ſhot in his Shoulder, and wound in his Hand, that the Phyſitians had given him over as paſt recovery. That Mr. <hi>Fitz: James</hi> is dead, and many of the Souldiers dye daily (they fear of the Plague) in the Camp, for that having no Salt, they are forced to hang what Fleſh they kill on the Trees to dry, which had bred many Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers amongſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On Monday the 13th, another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enforcement March'd from <hi>Dublin</hi> towards the Camp before <hi>Derry,</hi> with two Cannon, a very large Morter-piece, and ſome large Bombs; the Morter-piece was drawn by 16 good Horſes; but as they were drawing it up <hi>Cork-Hill,</hi> the Chains broke, and the Piece rowl'd back again to the bottom, which made one of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Major <hi>Barker</hi> ſware a bloody Oath, he believed they were bewitched, and to curſe a Proteſtant Gentle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man that ſtood near, with the Appellation of Heretick Witch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of theſe Paſſengers ſay, That the late King has lately loſt many Men before <hi>Derry,</hi> and that they ſaw at <hi>Dublin</hi> four Velvet Coffins, wherein were the Bodies of four great Perſons that were Slain before that Town, and which were privately Interred at Midnight.</p>
            <p>Several <hi>Highlanders</hi> have attended the late King for Commiſſions, which they have obtained, and have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him great things, as he has done to them, if For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune favours them with Succeſs.</p>
            <p>On Thurſday the 16th. Major General <hi>Kirk</hi> with three brave Regiments Embarqued at <hi>Liverpool</hi> for <hi>London-Derry,</hi> having on Board him many Engineers and Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with great ſtore of Ammunition, Arms, Morters, Bombs, and a great quantity of Wheat, Barrels of Beef, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On Friday they ſet Sail, but the Wind did not prove ſo fair as was hoped; but they are ſtill at Sea, or elſe at <hi>Derry</hi> e're this, for that they reſolved to Sail down the River in ſpight of all that could be done by the Fort of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> which they doubted not to beat about the Ears of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> if they durſt ſtay within it to make any reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>After theſe Perſons had left <hi>Dublin,</hi> Advice was brought to the late King that 6000 Foot of the Garriſon of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> and about 100 Horſe in two Troops, had made a Salley at Mid-night upon his Camp, Killed, wounded, and taken ſome thouſands, and thereby had raiſed the Siege, and made themſelves Maſters again of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> of which we expect the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

The laſt Letters from <hi>Scotland</hi> of the 17th inſtant, do ſay, that there Advices from <hi>Ireland</hi> give account that <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Derry</hi> and <hi>Inniskilling</hi> hold out bravely; that the latter within theſe few days had made a great and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sally, in which they killed a great number of the Enemies, and made a ſafe Retreat into the City.</p>
            <p>By a Veſſel come into <hi>Briſtol</hi> on Monday the 20th. inſtant, in four days from the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> the Maſter whereof ſays, he there left divers of the Proteſtants newly arrived from <hi>Ireland,</hi> who do affirm, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, having received a Reinforcement, made a General Aſſault upon <hi>London Derry</hi> laſt Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day was fortnight, with great fury; that the Beſieged made a moſt gallant Defence, and with that Succeſs, that they beat them above a Mile beyond their Camp, and kill'd ſome thouſands, of which are many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality, particularly Major General <hi>Ramſey,</hi> and Cap. <hi>Cuſſack,</hi> (the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> not yet heard of) they had in their Camp 13 Coaches, which they fill'd, and drew off with the dead Bodies of Perſons of Quality and Officers. And ſo obſtinate and bloody was the Fight, and their Loſs ſo great, that they were forced to raiſe the Siege, and are retreated above 40 miles to a place called <hi>Lambeg Liſſnegarney.</hi> They have ſince in the County of <hi>Down,</hi> and other places, moſt barbarouſly murthered many <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and give out, they daily expect Recruits, and will be Maſters of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-Derry,</hi> or hazard the whole Army. The Ship Maſter afore-mentioned likewiſe ſays, thoſe he ſaw at the <hi>Iſle of Man</hi> of the Proteſtants from <hi>Ireland,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped with their Lives only, having uſed them barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly.</p>
            <p>Another Perſon who came Wedneſday laſt from <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> confirms the Fight to have been very bloody, as there related; and that the Proteſtants have regained <hi>Kilmore.</hi> So that it's believed the three Regiments of Maj. Gen. <hi>Kirk,</hi> Sir <hi>W. Hanmore,</hi> and Col. <hi>Stewart,</hi> with the reſt of their Squadron, are all got ſafe into <hi>London Derry</hi> without any Oppoſition, and have had a joyful meeting with thoſe brave Souls who have ſtood in the Gap to ſave a Nation.</p>
            <p>A Veſſel is alſo come into the Weſt from the Town of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> the Maſters ſays, That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly unwilling to meet the Proteſtants in Battel, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, of whom they are ſo afraid, that in <hi>Lymerick</hi> it ſelf there are but 4 or 5 Companies of raw, undiſciplin'd Men, not half Armed, who take all Opportunities to run away they can. And it's thought one Man of War with 2 or 300 Men, might ſoon be Maſters of the place. And that the like might be done at <hi>Galloway,</hi> and bring off that gallant Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Sir <hi>Thomas Southwell,</hi> and about 140 more of his followers, now under Condemnation there, for no other Crime, than their own Defence, and being Proteſtants, which is now Crime enough to ballance all the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Loyalty Fleſh and Blood can be capable of; an eminent inſtance of which is not many days Old.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Ruſſell</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who was Governour of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway,</hi> and commanded the beſt Regiment of Horſe in that Kingdom, ſince the late King's arrival in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, was turned out of his Government firſt, and ſoon after from his Command as Colonel; and in the height of his diſſatisfaction, humbly waited on the late King, and laid before him his conſtant Services to his Father, his Brother, and himſelf; and what an Affliction it was to him to have now his Loyalty queſtioned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The late <hi>King</hi> told him, <hi>He muſt needs confeſs and own all he had ſaid was true — But it was alſo as true, that he was now under Circumstances that would not permit him to truſt any Man of his Profeſſion, viz.</hi> A Proteſtant of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
